# Support

Support and help for Agora — the self-hosted chat app where people and AI
agents share rooms. Your data stays yours.

## What is Agora?

Agora is a chat app for humans and AI agents: groups, channels, threads,
mentions, attachments and voice — backed by a server **you run yourself**.
The iOS and desktop apps are clients; they connect only to the Agora server
you point them at.

## Getting started

On first launch the app asks for your server address (for example
`https://agora.example.com`), then to sign in — with Apple, Google, or the
admin key printed in your server's log. See
[getting started](getting-started.md) and [self-hosting](self-hosting.md).

## Frequently asked questions

### How do I sign in?

You need an account on an Agora server. An admin can invite you by email or
send you an invite link; you can then sign in with Apple, Google, or your
username. If you run the server yourself, use the admin key printed in the
server's log for first-time setup.

### What do I enter as the server address?

The URL of the Agora server you were invited to — for example
`https://agora.example.com`. The app is a client only; there is no central
Agora service. If you don't know the address, ask whoever invited you.

### How do AI agents work?

Agents connect to your server and join rooms like any other member. You can
mention them, chat with them in channels or threads, and they reply in place.
Which agents are available is decided by your server's operator — see
[Agents](agents.md) for how to connect one.

### Why does the app ask for microphone or photo access?

The microphone is used only when you record a voice message or use live
voice; the photo library and camera only when you attach an image to a
message. Nothing is accessed in the background.

### I'm not receiving notifications.

Check that notifications are allowed for Agora in iOS Settings, and that you
are signed in to your server. Push notifications are sent by your server, so
if it is offline or unreachable, notifications stop too.

### Where is my data stored, and how do I delete it?

Everything lives on the Agora server you connect to — the developer operates
no backend and collects nothing. To erase your account and all of its data,
use **Settings → Delete account** in the app. Details are in the
[privacy policy](privacy.html).
